\title{random_pdf_negative_binomial:Computes the value of the PDF of samples of
negative binomial distributions with parameters *k* (failure limit) and *p* (failure probability).}
\usage{
mx.symbol.random_pdf_negative_binomial(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Samples from the distributions.}

\item{k}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Limits of unsuccessful experiments.}

\item{is.log}{boolean, optional, default=0
If set, compute the density of the log-probability instead of the probability.}

\item{p}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Failure probabilities in each experiment.}

\item{name}{string, optional
Name of the resulting symbol.}
}
\value{
out The result mx.symbol
}
\description{
*k* and *p* must have the same shape, which must match the leftmost subshape
of *sample*.  That is, *sample* can have the same shape as *k* and *p*, in which
case the output contains one density per distribution, or *sample* can be a tensor
of tensors with that shape, in which case the output is a tensor of densities such that
the densities at index *i* in the output are given by the samples at index *i* in *sample*
parameterized by the values of *k* and *p* at index *i*.
