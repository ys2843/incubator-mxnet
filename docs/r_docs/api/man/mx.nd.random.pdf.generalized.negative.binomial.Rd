\title{Computes the value of the PDF of *sample* of
generalized negative binomial distributions with parameters *mu* (mean)
and *alpha* (dispersion).  This can be understood as a reparameterization of
the negative binomial, where *k* = *1 / alpha* and *p* = *1 / (mu \* alpha + 1)*.}
\arguments{
\item{sample}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Samples from the distributions.}

\item{mu}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Means of the distributions.}

\item{is.log}{boolean, optional, default=0
If set, compute the density of the log-probability instead of the probability.}

\item{alpha}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Alpha (dispersion) parameters of the distributions.}
}
\value{
out The result mx.ndarray
}
\description{
*mu* and *alpha* must have the same shape, which must match the leftmost subshape
of *sample*.  That is, *sample* can have the same shape as *mu* and *alpha*, in which
case the output contains one density per distribution, or *sample* can be a tensor
of tensors with that shape, in which case the output is a tensor of densities such that
the densities at index *i* in the output are given by the samples at index *i* in *sample*
parameterized by the values of *mu* and *alpha* at index *i*.
