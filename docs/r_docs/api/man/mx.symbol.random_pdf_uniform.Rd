\title{random_pdf_uniform:Computes the value of the PDF of *sample* of
uniform distributions on the intervals given by *[low,high)*.}
\usage{
mx.symbol.random_pdf_uniform(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Samples from the distributions.}

\item{low}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Lower bounds of the distributions.}

\item{is.log}{boolean, optional, default=0
If set, compute the density of the log-probability instead of the probability.}

\item{high}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Upper bounds of the distributions.}

\item{name}{string, optional
Name of the resulting symbol.}
}
\value{
out The result mx.symbol
}
\description{
*low* and *high* must have the same shape, which must match the leftmost subshape
of *sample*.  That is, *sample* can have the same shape as *low* and *high*, in which
case the output contains one density per distribution, or *sample* can be a tensor
of tensors with that shape, in which case the output is a tensor of densities such that
the densities at index *i* in the output are given by the samples at index *i* in *sample*
parameterized by the values of *low* and *high* at index *i*.

Examples::

    random_pdf_uniform(sample=[[1,2,3,4]], low=[0], high=[10]) = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

    sample = [[[1, 2, 3],
               [1, 2, 3]],
              [[1, 2, 3],
               [1, 2, 3]]]
    low  = [[0, 0],
            [0, 0]]
    high = [[ 5, 10],
            [15, 20]]
    random_pdf_uniform(sample=sample, low=low, high=high) =
        [[[0.2,        0.2,        0.2    ],
          [0.1,        0.1,        0.1    ]],
         [[0.06667,    0.06667,    0.06667],
          [0.05,       0.05,       0.05   ]]]
