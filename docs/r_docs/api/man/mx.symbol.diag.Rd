\title{diag:Extracts a diagonal or constructs a diagonal array.}
\usage{
mx.symbol.diag(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{NDArray-or-Symbol
Input ndarray}

\item{k}{int, optional, default='0'
Diagonal in question. The default is 0. Use k>0 for diagonals above the main diagonal, and k<0 for diagonals below the main diagonal. If input has shape (S0 S1) k must be between -S0 and S1}

\item{axis1}{int, optional, default='0'
The first axis of the sub-arrays of interest. Ignored when the input is a 1-D array.}

\item{axis2}{int, optional, default='1'
The second axis of the sub-arrays of interest. Ignored when the input is a 1-D array.}

\item{name}{string, optional
Name of the resulting symbol.}
}
\value{
out The result mx.symbol
}
\description{
``diag``'s behavior depends on the input array dimensions:
}
\details{
- 1-D arrays: constructs a 2-D array with the input as its diagonal, all other elements are zero.
- N-D arrays: extracts the diagonals of the sub-arrays with axes specified by ``axis1`` and ``axis2``.
  The output shape would be decided by removing the axes numbered ``axis1`` and ``axis2`` from the
  input shape and appending to the result a new axis with the size of the diagonals in question.

  For example, when the input shape is `(2, 3, 4, 5)`, ``axis1`` and ``axis2`` are 0 and 2
  respectively and ``k`` is 0, the resulting shape would be `(3, 5, 2)`.

Examples::

  x = [[1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6]]

  diag(x) = [1, 5]

  diag(x, k=1) = [2, 6]

  diag(x, k=-1) = [4]

  x = [1, 2, 3]

  diag(x) = [[1, 0, 0],
             [0, 2, 0],
             [0, 0, 3]]

  diag(x, k=1) = [[0, 1, 0],
                  [0, 0, 2],
                  [0, 0, 0]]

  diag(x, k=-1) = [[0, 0, 0],
                   [1, 0, 0],
                   [0, 2, 0]]

  x = [[[1, 2],
        [3, 4]],

       [[5, 6],
        [7, 8]]]

  diag(x) = [[1, 7],
             [2, 8]]

  diag(x, k=1) = [[3],
                  [4]]

  diag(x, axis1=-2, axis2=-1) = [[1, 4],
                                 [5, 8]]
