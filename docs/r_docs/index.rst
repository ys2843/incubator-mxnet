MXNet in R 
======================

MXNet offers an straightforward yet powerful interface to utilize deep learning in the R programming language.
This website contains documentation and tutorials for working with the `mxnet R package <https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/R-package>`_, which brings flexible and efficient GPU tensor/matrix computation and state-of-art deep learning to R.  By calling simple R functions, you can quickly train neural networks via multiple GPUs over massive datasets from image, text, and other domains.

For more information about MXNet, see the `main site <http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org>`_.
